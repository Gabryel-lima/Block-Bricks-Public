## Description

Block-Bricks is a 2D puzzle game implemented in Python using Pygame. It draws inspiration from classic 2D block games, challenging players to clear the board by eliminating groups of blocks. Have fun and test your puzzle-solving skills in this addictive game!

This project is continuously evolving, with new versions and improvements in development. We are currently working on demonstrating the integration of artificial intelligence to enhance gameplay. Initially, the AI will be used to play and interact with the game, showcasing the potential of machine learning in solving in-game challenges.
